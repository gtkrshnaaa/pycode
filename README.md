# **Pycode: A Lightweight and Modular TUI IDE**

**Background**

In a landscape dominated by feature-rich but often resource-intensive IDEs, this project was born from a need for a development environment that is lightweight, fast, and fully terminal-based. This IDE is not just a tool; it's a testament to the principle of **efficiency without compromise**. It's designed to run seamlessly in minimalist environments like a VPS or low-resource machines, without sacrificing essential functionality.

**Vision**

The core vision of this project is to deliver a highly modular IDE. Each component is purpose-built to focus on a single task and work together in harmony. The IDE aims to provide an intuitive and rapid coding experience by separating the logic for the user interface, the text editor, and supporting functionalities like Git and the terminal into distinct, manageable modules. With this approach, we aim to prove that high performance and modern features can coexist within the terminal environment.

**Technology Stack**

This project is built on a foundation of proven and efficient technologies. Each choice was made with performance and ease of development in mind.

* **`Textual`**: Serves as the primary framework for building the Terminal User Interface (TUI). `Textual` was chosen for its modern approach to managing complex layouts and widgets.
* **`prompt-toolkit`**: The engine for the text editor. This is a crucial choice to ensure the editor can handle large files efficiently by only rendering the visible parts.
* **`GitPython`**: This library acts as the bridge for seamless Git integration, enabling features like file status detection and line-by-line code changes.

**Code Partner**

This project is the result of a unique collaboration between a visionary developer and an AI assistant.

* **gtkrshnaaa**: The primary developer and architect who conceived the project's core concepts and vision.
* **Caecillia (@gtkrshnaaa AI Assistant)**: An AI collaborator who assists in brainstorming ideas, mapping the architecture, and providing technical solutions throughout the development process.

### **Conceptual Map: TUI IDE Architecture**

**1. Core Foundation**

* **Main Application**: **`Textual`**
    * Acts as the primary framework.
    * Manages the **layout** with a panel and widget system.
    * Responsible for rendering the overall interface.
* **Core Component**: **`prompt-toolkit`**
    * Functions as the efficient **text editor engine**.
    * Embedded within the main Textual panel.
    * Manages all typing, cursor navigation, text **buffer**, and syntax highlighting logic.

**2. User Interface Components**

* **Left Sidebar**: `Directory Tree` Widget
    * **Purpose**: Displays the hierarchical directory and file structure.
    * **Interaction**: Sends a signal to the editor panel when a user selects a file.
    * **Git Integration**: Displays the Git status of each file/directory (e.g., `M` for modified, `U` for untracked).
* **Center Panel**: `Text Editor` Widget (from `prompt-toolkit`)
    * **Purpose**: Displays and allows editing of the selected file's content.
    * **Features**:
        * Standard **key bindings** (`Ctrl-S`, `Ctrl-C`, `Ctrl-V`).
        * **Syntax highlighting** (requires additional logic).
        * Cursor navigation and scrolling.
        * `Undo/Redo` functionality.
        * Git `diff` visualization on a per-line basis.
* **Bottom Panel**: Interactive Terminal (`Textual` Terminal Widget)
    * **Purpose**: Runs a real shell terminal inside the IDE.
    * **Features**:
        * Supports multiple terminal tabs.
        * A navigator to switch between terminals.
        * Supports standard terminal output and input.

**3. Smart Features & Integrations**

* **Quick File Search (`Ctrl+P`)**
    * **Concept**: Uses a `modal dialog` from **`Textual`**.
    * **Process**:
        1.  The user presses `Ctrl+P`.
        2.  Textual displays a **pop-up window**.
        3.  The user types a filename.
        4.  Search logic (which only searches the `Directory Tree` in memory) displays matching results in real-time.
* **Git Integration**
    * **Library**: **`GitPython`**
    * **Workflow**:
        1.  The IDE detects changes in the Git repository.
        2.  Uses `GitPython` to get the `status` and `diff`.
        3.  Displays a status indicator on the `Directory Tree` (e.g., an `M` icon).
        4.  Sends the `diff` data to `prompt-toolkit` to visualize line changes in the editor.

### **Conclusion: Pycode - A New Paradigm for TUI IDEs**

The **Pycode** project represents a significant step forward in the world of terminal-based development. While many IDEs prioritize a wide array of features, often at the cost of performance and resource efficiency, Pycode was conceived with a different philosophy: to create a development environment that is **lightweight, fast, and highly modular**.

By leveraging a carefully selected technology stack—including **Textual** for the UI, **prompt-toolkit** for the core editor, and **GitPython** for seamless Git integration—Pycode proves that a terminal-based IDE can deliver a powerful and intuitive coding experience. This project isn't just a tool; it's a demonstration that high performance and modern features can coexist harmoniously within a minimalist, resource-friendly environment.

In essence, Pycode challenges the conventional idea of what an IDE should be. It’s a testament to the principle that with a clear vision and a smart, modular design, you can build something truly powerful that is also efficient and elegant.
